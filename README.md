# React Exercises 2.1 – 2.5

## Overview
This project is a React course information app that renders course details, parts, and exercises dynamically using components and props.

## What I Learned
- Creating and composing React components (`App`, `Course`, `Header`, `Content`, `Part`)
- Passing data between components using props
- Rendering dynamic content from arrays
- Calculating totals with `reduce`
- Handling multiple courses dynamically
- Modularizing components for clean code

## Features
- Render course name and parts
- Show total exercises per course
- Support multiple courses
- Separate module for `Course` component
